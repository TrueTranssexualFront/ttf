        <p>You might be wondering what you can do to help us. For starters, you should consider signing up for a reddit account (if you haven't already) and joining our <a href="https://reddit.com/r/TrueTranssexualFront">subreddit</a>. You can also talk about us online and link to this website on anonymous accounts; make sure to use hashtags if the platform has them (such as on Tumblr or Twitter). You can write a letter to your lawmakers about our struggle (such as by explaining how radical gender ideology harms us and why we deserve to be able to socially, medically, and legally transition), and you could even go further; maybe write a letter to a billionaire politician. Make sure it is generally free from grammatical errors; small ones that are hard to notice are okay, but spelling mistakes might make it seem sloppy. I'll also be making some flyers soon, which I'll most likely post on this webpage as well as the subreddit. I will update this webpage with more ways to help soon.</p>

        <h1 class="title">How to help</h1>
        <p>You might be wondering what you can do to help us. For starters, you should consider signing up for a reddit account (if you haven't already) and joining our <a href="https://reddit.com/r/TrueTranssexualFront">subreddit</a>. You can also talk about us online and link to this website on anonymous accounts; make sure to use hashtags if the platform has them (such as on Tumblr or Twitter). You can write a letter to your lawmakers about our struggle (such as by explaining how radical gender ideology harms us and why we deserve to be able to socially, medically, and legally transition), and you could even go further; maybe write a letter to a billionaire politician. Make sure it is generally free from grammatical errors; small ones that are hard to notice are okay, but spelling mistakes might make it seem sloppy. However, if you are a minor, then I strongly urge you to write it anonymously and not include a return address. I'll also be making some flyers soon, which I'll most likely post on this webpage as well as the subreddit. I will update this webpage with more ways to help soon.</p>

        <p>You can also make your own flyer, card, or whatever if you wish, however, please respect the following guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It should follow the <a href="tenets">tenets</a>.</li>
            <li>It should have "www.TrueTranssexualFront.org" somewhere noticeable (it will redirect to truetranssexualfront.org, without the www, although the www makes it obvious that it's a website).</li>
            <li>Generally, things like "stop transgenderism" or "stop radical gender ideology" are a good idea sometimes, but make sure that you make it obvious that you're in support of <i>transsexuals</i>. So "stop radical gender ideology" could become "we as transsexuals say NO to radical gender ideology!", or something to that effect. Then you could put an explanation as to <i>why</i> it hurts us, and maybe why the reader should care.</li>
            <li>It should not have something that could create division. Let's say you're in America for instance; "transsexuals want HARRIS for America" or "transsexuals want TRUMP for America" or "transsexuals want [ANY OTHER POLITICIAN] for America" would be against these guidelines, with a possible exception if said politican were in support of our movement/ideals.</li>
            <li>Please don't put anything about unrelated movements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, let's talk about <i>where</i> you should and should not put them. "At" means inside or on the general premises of.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You shouldn't put one up at a school or university.</li>
            <li>You shouldn't put one up at a Nazi rally or anything like that.</li>
            <li>You shouldn't put one up at a place if someone has told you not to do so and they have the authority to say that.</li>
            <li>You shouldn't put one up somewhere where it would be considered vandalism. Please don't damage property while putting it up; you can use tape, but it shouldn't be any stronger than painter's tape.</li>
            <li>You shouldn't put one up on private property that is labeled as "PRIVATE PROPERTY" (or the equivalent term in your language) by a sign.</li>
            <li>You shouldn't put one up at an LGBT event.</li>
            <li>You shouldn't put one up at someone's house.</li>
            <li>This webpage typically assumes it's a stationary flyer, but other forms are allowed too, such as little cards (kind of like business cards) or even protest signs. However, no matter what you do, I generally encourage you to follow those rules. If taping a flyer might get you in trouble, consider printing it out as a little card instead and just leaving some.</li>
            <li>If you're in America, don't put it directly in someone's mailbox; <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:18 section:1725 edition:prelim)">it's a felony</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Obviously if you break these guidelines then we can't really stop you, but these guidelines are here to make the movement as effective as possible (and also just to make sure you don't accidentally break the law). If you think that these guidelines have issues, or you think that your idea is worthy of an exception, please email me or make a post about it on our subreddit. If you're unsure, post it on the subreddit.</p>

        <p>Creativity is encouraged.</p>

        <p>Consider letting me know (such as by email) when you've put some up or even just made a post about it online. Additionally, if you're posting online, you can include the hashtag #TrueTranssexualFront.</p>

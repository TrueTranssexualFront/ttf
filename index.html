		<p>Ever since the word "transgender" became mainstream, transsexuals have been silenced and used as a meat shield by transgenderists, dragging us down. Because transsexuals are typically stealth anyway, few of us speak out for our safety. But xe/they/it/star people who have never felt gender dysphoria in their lives can keep screaming as loud as they want and saying stupid things that cause people to think they're worse and worse without any consequences; even if they legally cannot transition anymore then they will barely be affected as they will simply go back to living as a normal man or woman, which they can do because as I said, no dysphoria. However, if this happens to transsexuals due to the transgenderists (as we are almost always grouped in with them), detransitioning is not an option for us. It would mean the return to an agonizing existence which we would do anything to avoid. Radical gender ideology is a threat to the future of transsexuals.</p>
